However  the kit was shipped in an ordinary padded envelope and its little cardboard box didn't survive the rigors of the postal service. It was dented and smashed. In addition  the cardboard packaging looked like it had been exposed to moisture  it was slightly puffed in areas and looked old and used. Overall the kit that I received was not in gift-giving condition although the contents were unharmed. It was very disappointing.\n",

The author spent a great deal of time detailing the mathematical advances and controversies that spurred the technological advances we see today. Overall the book was mildly interesting  but probably not for the average reader. On the other end of the spectrum it was too much of a primer for anyone with some historical knowledge of mathematics and its part in developing computers.\n",

I never did figure out what the mute boy had to do with anything in the film. I am surprised Morgan Freeman even took part in this horrible movie.\n",

Micheal Myers is the coolest horror movie killer I can think of  and calling this a sequal to #1  and 2 is an insult to the movies. It wasn't even that scary  and the plot was horrible  even worst than Nightmare on Elm Street  and that is saying something. The only thing I can think of that is good is the director  but he made a terrible mistake with this movie. So I give it a 1 star. For that one factor. People may say this movie is okay and stuff. But a horror movie that has nothing to do with it's prequels  that's not scary almost at all  has a horrible plot  and is just plain stupid  is not worth calling what it is. Dont watch this movie. Maybe  maybe rent it just to see why it is such a bad movie  and then you can tell all your friends that you just saw a horrible movie. Well  that's all I have to say.\n",

It's an overlong mess with the CGI eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film.

It's not his forté and hasn't been since The Rock. The movie peaks with a huge  final battle in Chicago that is nuts  but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place.

With the exception of one track  the lyrics are in English. The lead singer  Andrea Nebel Haugan  can actually sing! Professionally done and melodic.Many of my non-Heathen friends also enjoy listening to this CD.\n",
      "\t- Not what I expected: I should have read what the cd was about. I thought it was just music by Chopin but it was really a lot of soprano singing.\n",
      "\t- Oh  my God! It's Stereolab!!!: Ever since I got this album since last summer  I kept on thinking what this album will sound like. I never wanted to stop listening to this album  because their music is so spectacular. If you heard the first track  Laetitia kinda does the loud humming and someone keeps on playing the synthesizer. It reminds me of the Beatles' eerie song  Revolution 9  from the  White Album.  I could've just imagined while listening to  Baby Lulu  and it makes your mind clear with soothing and beautiful sounds. This is the best album I've ever heard  and I listen to this album while I study and you should listen to this while you're at work or home. Stereolab totally gets your stresses away by listening to them. Bye-Bye! :-)\n",
      "\t- Excellent Album: I have known Kenneth copland since 1973. He has always set very high standards for the recording & prpduction of all his albums. This album is no exception.\n",

      "\t- Transformers: Dark of the moon: All I can say is AWESOME  the family loved it and was so very HAPPY to watch and enjoy on a great family evening  Thanks Bunches!\n",
      "\t- Great Product: A friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress. I brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but I needed a small. It was extremely difficult to put on so I needed assistance. Once it was on I was still able to contract my core  which meant that I needed a smaller size. I believe it is because my waist sits high on my torso. Other then that this is great buy.\n",
      "\t- great mattress: I am in Iraq and this mattress is great. It is 100x more comfortable then the things they call mattresses over here.\n",
      "\t- Charlie Brown Christmas: One of my favorite Christmas shows of all time! Great service from the provider.\n",
      "\t- Great Bed for Guests: Bought this for my Grandson to sleep on when the family came to visit over Christmas. It is wonderful. . . super easy to inflate (and deflate) nicely raised off the floor and he said it was very comfortable. Grandma scored a home run on this one!\n",

      "\t- Do Not Buy This Software!: I tried this software as an alternative to ULead's DVD PictureShow. The good news: DVD Photoplay makes it easier to load pictures into a slide show project than ULead's software.The bad news: THE SOFTWARE DOESN'T WORK. I've tested the program on three computers: An IBM Laptop with a HP USB CD Writer  a Dell desktop with an internal CD Writer  and a Sony VAIO desktop with an internal CD Writer. Whenever I tried to write the project to CD  the software failed to recognize my CD Writer on each machine.I emailed customer support  and though I was assured I would receive an answer within 3 days  10 days later I still haven't heard from them.I wish I had kept my receipt so that I could get my money back for this worthless software...\n",
      "\t- Almost perfect CD: The only reason I am giving this CD 4 stars instead of 5  is because it is too short! Lhasa's voice is sultry  sad and powerful. The music is haunting yet airy. Perfection!\n",
      "\t- CUT IT UP DEF: IT'S OLD SCHOOL JAMS!!! I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR THIS CD FOR THE LONGEST. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT.\n",
      "\t- garbage: Complete garbage  the sound quality is horrible  if your going to release a best of cd  record it with something other than a preschool microphone covered with a wet rag.\n",
      "\t- Waste of money!: Like many of the Barbie CD Roms  the playtime is limited - averaging about 5 mins for each of my two daughters (ages 5 & 7). Like the Barbie movies and other CD Roms the graphics are poorly done.\n",
